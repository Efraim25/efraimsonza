<p> The importance of forests cannot be underestimated.
    We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use. Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change. Yet, despite our dependence on forests, we are still allowing them to disappear.</p>

	<h2>Importance</h2>

<p>After oceans, forests are the world’s largest storehouses of carbon
    They provide ecosystem services that are critical to human welfare. These include:
     
    Absorbing harmful greenhouse gasses that produce climate change. In tropical forests alone, a quarter of a trillion tons of carbon is stored in above and below ground biomass
    Providing clean water for drinking, bathing, and other household needs
    Protecting watersheds and reducing or slowing the amount of erosion and chemicals that reach waterways
    Providing food and medicine
    Serving as a buffer in natural disasters like flood and rainfalls
    Providing habitat to more than half of the world’s land-based species</p>
